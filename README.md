ankit.io
========

This is the old version of my website that runs on Flask. It's kinda overkill for static web pages, so [I moved it](https://github.com/ankitr/ankitr.github.io). It's online for reference purposes. Some of the code isn't fully functional, as I engineered this to be a far larger project than necessary.
